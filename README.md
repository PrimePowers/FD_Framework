# FD_Framework
This repository implements a stability-based framework derived from the Weil explicit formula, mapping arithmetic data into finite Gram systems in logarithmic coordinates. Increasing height  𝑇 T amplifies spectral deviations, enabling numerical and topological diagnostics of rigidity and stability.
